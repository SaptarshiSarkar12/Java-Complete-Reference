Computer language innovation and development occurs for two fundamental reasons: </br>
    - To adapt to changing environments and uses. </br>
    - To implement refinements and improvements in the art of programming.

 The development of Java was driven by both elements in nearly equal measure.

 From C, Java derives its syntax. Many of Javaâ€™s object-oriented features were influenced by C++.

 In addition to simplifying web programming in general, Java innovated a new type of networked program called the applet that changed the way the online world thought about content.
 An applet is a special kind of Java program that is designed to be transmitted over the Internet and automatically executed by a Java-compatible web browser.
 In order for Java to enable applets to be downloaded and executed on the client computer safely, it was necessary to prevent an applet from launching such an attack. Java achieved this protection by confining an applet to the Java execution environment and not allowing it access to other parts of the computer.
 The key that allows Java to solve both the security and the portability problems just described is that the output of a Java compiler is not executable code. Rather, it is bytecode.
